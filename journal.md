A game I really enjoyed is "DeltaRune" by Toby Fox. DeltaRune presents its world in a 2D format. The story is filled with mysteries and wonders. The game mechanics like puzzles, riddles, random and hilarious conversations, character design, music(banger sound track) , and the fighting mechanics all play apart in the story the game is showing. The game itself isn't complete but with only 2 chapters AND being free. This game is a delight to play and id recommend playing it sometime.

I personally did not find any of the steps complicated or difficult. I encountered no difficulties in following the steps. I do believe for others, it should be stated there is spaces for the title. ("# September num, num")
