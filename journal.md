A game I really enjoyed is "DeltaRune" by Toby Fox. DeltaRune presents its world in a 2D format. The story is filled with mysteries and wonders. The game mechanics like puzzles, riddles, random and hilarious conversations, character design, music(banger sound track) , and the fighting mechanics all play apart in the story the game is showing. The game itself isn't complete but with only 2 chapters AND being free. This game is a delight to play and id recommend playing it sometime.

I personally did not find any of the steps complicated or difficult. I encountered no difficulties in following the steps. I do believe for others, it should be stated there is spaces for the title. ("# September num, num")

Precision affects the outcome of a program by giving a more desirable result or possibly even the opposite. For example, when you shot an arrow at a target, you want it to hit closest to the middle. archery isn't just aim and fire. You must take in account for wind, pull back, and projectile drop. The more detail you take into mind the more of a desirable result youll get. Same goes with coding, but once you get the fundamentals youll just do it naturally.

Ive study music theory on my free time for the role of music composition. The main role of this is to produce music of course! Well, effectively and with quality. You'll probably wanna know a fair bit about music theory. Having a keen ear to pitches is wonderful to have. 3 to 2 years of music theory should be fine. Usually, people will look at you're experience over education. The music industry is always growing so there are plenty of opportunities. My career of music aligns with my interest in programming because you can't have a game without a banger soundtrack.

Programming or coding can improve problems thinking skills by making someone have to think outside the box. For instance, there are a million of ways to say hello, by the person you're speaking to will only understand one and you have to be very specific in the conversation. This can be troublesome at times.
By understanding atleast the basis of programming and going through the hours of trouble it has. You'll soon naturally think outside the options that are presented. For example, say you have a block of iron. What would you do with it? Most people would probably sell or have ot as a house decore. Why not use it? Why not use it to repair your other metal appliances? Or make something cooler, better? 
Yes, annoyingly....

Ai is a difficult topic to describe because there is really so much to unravel.You might know AI as those silly image generators, but Ai is way more than that. Ai can help reduce the work load for coders/programmers giving them prefixes to work with. 

On the other hand, alot of artist arr worried that AI will be able to make art better than actual artist. Same with music producer. Countless artist have spoken against ai due to this fact. Even the flim industry id potentially endanger.

Technology has expanded the food industry greatly. Production, waste management, and ordering food has enhanced so much during these times is starting to become very accessible to all. Some negative effects though is many people lose jobs from technology.

I use FL studio to make music/compose music on a daily. This allows me to express my musical prowess and challenges my composition skills.
