A game I really enjoyed is "DeltaRune" by Toby Fox. DeltaRune presents its world in a 2D format. The story is filled with mysteries and wonders. The game mechanics like puzzles, riddles, random and hilarious conversations, character design, music(banger sound track) , and the fighting mechanics all play apart in the story the game is showing. The game itself isn't complete but with only 2 chapters AND being free. This game is a delight to play and id recommend playing it sometime.

I personally did not find any of the steps complicated or difficult. I encountered no difficulties in following the steps. I do believe for others, it should be stated there is spaces for the title. ("# September num, num")

Precision affects the outcome of a program by giving a more desirable result or possibly even the opposite. For example, when you shot an arrow at a target, you want it to hit closest to the middle. archery isn't just aim and fire. You must take in account for wind, pull back, and projectile drop. The more detail you take into mind the more of a desirable result youll get. Same goes with coding, but once you get the fundamentals youll just do it naturally.

Ive study music theory on my free time for the role of music composition. The main role of this is to produce music of course! Well, effectively and with quality. You'll probably wanna know a fair bit about music theory. Having a keen ear to pitches is wonderful to have. 3 to 2 years of music theory should be fine. Usually, people will look at you're experience over education. The music industry is always growing so there are plenty of opportunities. My career of music aligns with my interest in programming because you can't have a game without a banger soundtrack.

Programming or coding can improve problems thinking skills by making someone have to think outside the box. For instance, there are a million of ways to say hello, by the person you're speaking to will only understand one and you have to be very specific in the conversation. This can be troublesome at times.
By understanding atleast the basis of programming and going through the hours of trouble it has. You'll soon naturally think outside the options that are presented. For example, say you have a block of iron. What would you do with it? Most people would probably sell or have ot as a house decore. Why not use it? Why not use it to repair your other metal appliances? Or make something cooler, better? 
Yes, annoyingly....

Ai is a difficult topic to describe because there is really so much to unravel.You might know AI as those silly image generators, but Ai is way more than that. Ai can help reduce the work load for coders/programmers giving them prefixes to work with. 

On the other hand, alot of artist arr worried that AI will be able to make art better than actual artist. Same with music producer. Countless artist have spoken against ai due to this fact. Even the flim industry id potentially endanger.

Technology has expanded the food industry greatly. Production, waste management, and ordering food has enhanced so much during these times is starting to become very accessible to all. Some negative effects though is many people lose jobs from technology.

I use FL studio to make music/compose music on a daily. This allows me to express my musical prowess and challenges my composition skills.

I am feeling stressed with all the upcoming testing and physically I feel tired because of my wacky sleep schedule. the most stressful part of the day has to be 3rd period which is my English class. ive been struggling yo sometimes keep up with the work.

I believe the most useful features AI will offer in my opinion are having something to refer to and check work with. Ai Is always there which means you can study at anytime and for how ever long.

The Florida ban is beneficial to the working environment because students won't be waiting for the next buzz, beep, or flash on their phone distracting them from working and even slowing work down.

BUT! These policies can be a risk to student study and mental health. Students could be stuck somewhere (for example the bathroom) maybe after a fight unable to call for help. If a student is having a medical issue and the emergency number can't pick up what are first responders supposed to do?

Computer science is very valuable in filmmaking because it helps with editing, animation, and special effects. Programs like Adobe Premiere Pro use AI to speed up editing by suggesting cuts or fixing color. In animated movies like *Toy Story*, computer algorithms bring characters to life with realistic movement and lighting. Filmmakers also use coding to create new tools for visual effects and 3D modeling. Thanks to computer science, movies can be made faster, look better, and tell more creative stories.

I believe that using AI tools for “vibe coding” can be helpful, but students need to use them responsibly. AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can explain coding concepts and help students solve problems faster, especially when they’re stuck or learning something new. For example, if a student doesn’t understand how loops work, they can ask AI for examples and explanations in real time. However, relying too much on AI might stop students from truly learning how to code on their own. If they always copy and paste solutions, they may struggle when they have to code without help. So, while AI can be a great learning assistant, it should be used to support understanding, not replace effort and practice.

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of jobs. Companies like IKEA are already testing this by letting people work in virtual reality to help customers shop online. This shows that virtual jobs can be just as useful as real-world ones, especially as technology keeps improving. Many people already spend time in virtual worlds, like games or the metaverse, so turning that into a paid job could create more opportunities. It also helps people who can't work in person, like those with disabilities or who live in remote areas. Virtual jobs could make work more flexible and accessible for everyone. That’s why I believe they’re a smart step forward.

“67” isn’t just a number when people say it. It’s more like an inside joke that spread too far to die. Someone once said it at the right time, and everyone laughed hard. Now it pops up in random conversations, whispered in hallways or shouted across rooms. It means nothing and everything at once. The tone is chaotic, funny, mysterious. People keep saying it because confusion is deliciously contagious.

# October 6, 2025
If I were in charge of my school, I’d make technology a tool, not a distraction. Cell phones would stay silent during class but could be used at lunch or free time. Chromebooks would be for learning, though I’d allow short breaks for creative or educational games. AI tools like ChatGPT would be encouraged for studying, writing help, and problem-solving. Blocking all games doesn’t teach responsibility—balance does. With smart rules, technology could make school more engaging, not less.
