A game I really enjoyed is "DeltaRune" by Toby Fox. DeltaRune presents its world in a 2D format. The story is filled with mysteries and wonders. The game mechanics like puzzles, riddles, random and hilarious conversations, character design, music(banger sound track) , and the fighting mechanics all play apart in the story the game is showing. The game itself isn't complete but with only 2 chapters AND being free. This game is a delight to play and id recommend playing it sometime.

I personally did not find any of the steps complicated or difficult. I encountered no difficulties in following the steps. I do believe for others, it should be stated there is spaces for the title. ("# September num, num")

Precision affects the outcome of a program by giving a more desirable result or possibly even the opposite. For example, when you shot an arrow at a target, you want it to hit closest to the middle. archery isn't just aim and fire. You must take in account for wind, pull back, and projectile drop. The more detail you take into mind the more of a desirable result youll get. Same goes with coding, but once you get the fundamentals youll just do it naturally.
